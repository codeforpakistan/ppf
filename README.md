# Digitally enabled citizen-led participatory processes

This framework is being written to help individuals and organizations to plan and conduct digital participatory processes using technology through open-source tools. Based on our learnings, we have tried to provide the best practices on how to plan a participatory process, find the right stakeholders, conduct participatory activities and maximize impact. It also contains the main dilemmas that tend to arise when designing participatory processes.

The framework is to guide the readers to get started:

These are recommendations and theories, not strict rules.
Follow your instincts, try new methods, and please share what you learn.
We hope that you learn about needs firsthand and use your rich insights to develop solutions that meet usersâ€™ needs, appeal to users and citizens on multiple levels, and improve lives.
